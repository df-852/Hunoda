### Key Files & Their Purpose
| File | Purpose | Critical Rules |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `index.html` | Homepage | Stacked footer, HUNODA logo centered |
| `style.css` | Global styling | Must not affect privacy page uniquely |
| `script.js` | Dynamic background | Fetches sunrise-sunset API, sets body bg |
| `privacy/index.html` | Privacy policy | Uses `.privacy-footer` class, not global footer |
| `404.html` | Error page | Must match homepage styling exactly |

## 4) Visual Style Guide

### Colors
| Element | Day | Night | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|-------|
| Background | `#FF4500` (orange) | `#000000` (black) | Dynamic via API |
| Logo text (homepage) | White (`#FFFFFF`) | White (`#FFFFFF`) | Never changes |
| Privacy page logo | Orange (`#FF4500`) | Black (`#000000`) | Dynamic via JS |
| Body text (privacy) | `#000000` | `#000000` | Static |
| Links | Inherit color + underline | Inherit color + underline | No visited color change |

### Typography
- **Font family:** `"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`
- **Logo size:** `clamp(70%, 9vw, 18mm)`
- **Body text (homepage footer):** `11px`
- **Body text (privacy page):** `calc(11pt * 0.9)` (10% smaller than homepage)
- **404 page "Hey!":** 20% larger than base
- **404 page link:** 20% smaller than base

### Footer Specifications

#### Homepage Footer

```CSS
footer {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 10px;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  font-size: 11px;
  opacity: 0.6;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
  text-align: center;
}
```
### Privacy Page Footer
```CSS
.privacy-footer {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 11px;
  opacity: 0.6;
  color: #000000;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
/* Mobile: switches to column */
```
### Responsive Breakpoints
 | Breakpoint | Behavior |
 | ---------- | -------- |
 | `≤480px` | Homepage footer allows text wrapping
 | `≤600px`  |	Privacy page footer stacks vertically

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
The CSP must always include:

    default-src 'self';
    connect-src 'self' https://api.sunrise-sunset.org https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com https://cloudflareinsights.com;
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.googletagmanager.com https://static.cloudflareinsights.com;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
    font-src 'self' data:;
    img-src 'self' data: https://www.googletagmanager.com https://www.google-analytics.com

### Clean URLs
- Privacy page: `/privacy` (not `/privacy.html`)
- Implement via folder structure: `privacy/index.html`
- All internal links must use clean URLs

## 5) Other Considerations

### Error Handling and Testing
- Always validate code for syntax errors before outputting (e.g., using code_execution tool).
- If an error occurs, report it in the summary with steps to fix.
- Test workflows/previews before merging — use PR comments for URLs/artifacts.

### Tool Usage
- Use `code_execution` for testing code snippets or validating outputs.
- Use `web_search` or `browse_page` for research (e.g., standards, benchmarks).
- Use `render_inline_citation` for sources from searches.
- Use other tools (e.g., `x_keyword_search` for social insights) when relevant to query.

## 6) Common Fixes & Lessons Learned

### Issue: Footer alignment on privacy page
- **Fix:** Use `.privacy-footer` class with `display: flex; justify-content: space-between;`
- **Mobile:** Switch to `flex-direction: column;`

### Issue: CSS affecting both homepage and privacy
- **Fix:** Always scope privacy-specific styles with unique class `(.privacy-footer)`, never reuse homepage classes.

### Issue: Minify workflow crashing
- **Cause:** Invisible character at start of `style.css`
- **Fix:** Re-save file in plain text editor, remove BOM, ensure first character is visible.

### Issue: Cloudflare beacon blocked by CSP
- **Fix:** Add `https://static.cloudflareinsights.com` to `script-src` and `https://cloudflareinsights.com to connect-src.`

### Issue: Visited links turning purple
- **Fix:** Always include `a:visited { color: inherit; }`

### Issue: Font size inconsistency between pages
- **Fix:** Use explicit `11px` for all footer text, not relative units.

## 7) Deployment & CI/CD

### Minify Workflow
- Runs on push to main
- Minifies HTML, CSS, JS
- If it fails: Check for invisible characters in CSS/JS files

### Manual Deploy (Emergency)
- Commit directly to main
- Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages rebuild
- Purge Cloudflare cache if changes don't appear

### SEO & Search Console
- Property type: Domain property (sc-domain:hunoda.com)
- Sitemap: /sitemap.xml (includes / and /privacy)
- Google Analytics: Connected via G-1TVNDQB0D5
- Schema: Organization markup with contact email

### Design Principles
- Match homepage as reference when in doubt
- Stacked footer is default (homepage style)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean, minimal, professional
- No visual surprises across pages

### Future Development Notes
- When adding blog/articles: Use /blog/ folder with index.html per post
- Readiness assessment tool: Will need JS framework (React/Vue) or vanilla JS
- Maintain CSP updates with any new external services

## 8) Guide Maintenance Protocol

### Purpose
The Guide Maintenance Section defines the standard process for creating, updating, and maintaining the `AI-COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md` file. Following this protocol ensures consistent formatting, accurate documentation, and efficient collaboration. 

### File Location
- **Repository Path:** `documentation/AI-COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md`
- **Access:** Available at `https://github.com/df-852/Hunoda/blob/main/documentation/AI-COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md`

### When to Update This Guide

Update this document when:
- New pages or features are added to the site
- Design preferences change (colors, fonts, spacing)
- New bugs are discovered and fixed
- Workflow configurations are modified
- New external services are integrated
- Any project decision that future sessions should know about

### Formatting rules

The formatting rules should be strictly followed to ensure the document is readable by human users, not just AI agents, and consistent throughout, making the information easy to read and understand. If formatting rules are not properly described in this document, fall back to the provided .md or .txt file, whichever is provided, and ensure the formatting is consistent. Indent and back line need to be strictly followed to ensure the format is consistent.

  - use "##" before the name of each main section (This set the correct size and style for each main section title)
  - use "###' before the name of each subsection (This set the correct size and style each subsection title)
  - Table formatting should follow the following format using "|" and "-----" to create the table border
  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data A   | Data B   |

 - Code formatting should always start after a break line and with three backticks followed by the name of the language identifier. The closing should use three backticks and should be on the line after the final line of code within the block, with no other content on that line.
- Use single backticks when you want to call out a short snippet of code, a filename, or a command within a sentence
- When creating or updating a file architecture diagram, or a sitemap, use two indents followed by this sign ├── for the root level and use this sign │ └── for subsequent level

### Output Files
- The AI agent should follow the instructions set out in this Guide, including when to update and the formatting rules
- The AI agent should provide a summary of the changes made with clear explanations for review by the user
- For any updates, the AI Agent should always consolidate the updates and output into a single file in .txt format, ready to be downloaded by the users.
- Output file should be in .txt format, consolidated, following the formatting rules to ensure readibility
